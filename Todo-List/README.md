# Project Name: A Todo List

## Project Description

A todo list is a fundamental tool for organizing tasks, managing time, and improving productivity. It helps individuals organize their tasks in a systematic manner. By listing down all the tasks that need to be done, individuals can prioritize them based on urgency, importance, or deadlines, ensuring that crucial tasks are not overlooked or forgotten. This reduces stress, improves memory, and enhances accountability, ultimately enabling individuals to work more efficiently, meet their deadlines, and achieve their goals effectively.

## Outcomes

This basic JavaScript project helped me grasp some important concepts such as:

- Event handling
- HTML template creation
- Appending HTML template to an HTML element
- Converting from an HTML string template to a DOM element
- Appending elements with the `appendChild()` method

Additionally, it helped me refine my skills in DOM traversing.
